Hi there! I am pursuing Master's in Computer Science at University of Montreal and Montreal Institute of Learning Algorithms, Mila. I am interested to leverage foundation models to address the generalization challenge in robotics. I am further motivated to improve robot's perception and language understanding capabilities, enabling them to perform long-horizon tasks.
