Hello! I am currently pursuing a Masterâ€™s in Computer Science at the University of Montreal and [MILA](https://mila.quebec/en). My research interests lie in leveraging foundation models to tackle the generalization challenges in robotics. Additionally, I am interested in exploring language grounding to execute long-horizon tasks in robot learning. 

Currently, I am doing a research project for cross-embodiment learning and generalization under the supervision of [Prof. Glen Berseth](https://neo-x.github.io).

Previously, I have
